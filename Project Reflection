# Project Reflection: CRUD Module & Dashboard for Grazioso Salvare

## ✨ Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

To write programs that are **maintainable**, **readable**, and **adaptable**, I focus on clean, modular code with clear documentation.

In **Project One**, I developed a reusable **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** Python module that interacted with a database. This module became the foundation for **Project Two**, allowing dashboard widgets to pull and manipulate real-time data seamlessly.

### ✅ Best Practices I Followed:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Database operations were kept separate from the interface/dashboard logic.
- **Descriptive Naming:** Functions and variables had clear, purposeful names.
- **Consistent Formatting & Comments:** Made the code easier to review, share, and maintain.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Using `try-except` blocks ensured stability and clear debugging.

### 🧠 Advantages of the CRUD Module:
- **Reusability:** Once built, it powered multiple features without duplicating logic.
- **Scalability:** The backend was designed to support future interface updates with minimal changes.
- **Consistency:** Centralizing data access ensured cleaner code and fewer bugs.

**Looking Ahead:**  
This module could serve as a base for future apps or dashboards—whether it's reporting tools, web apps, or even API endpoints.

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

As a computer scientist, I break down large problems into clear, actionable steps.

For the Grazioso Salvare project:
1. ✅ I reviewed the database schema and clarified the client's needs.
2. 🛠️ I developed the CRUD module to serve as a reliable data access layer.
3. 📊 I built dashboard widgets that connected to this backend.
4. 🔄 I iterated and tested, ensuring a smooth, functional experience for the end user.

### 🔍 Compared to Previous Coursework:
This project required real-world thinking—beyond isolated coding tasks. I had to:
- Think about **usability** and **client needs**
- Integrate **frontend and backend systems**
- Prioritize **code structure** and **long-term flexibility**

### 🧪 Strategies I’d Use Again:
- **ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams)** for database planning
- **Modular development** to separate logic cleanly
- **Client-focused user stories** to guide features
- **Test-driven development** for critical backend components

## 💻 What Computer Scientists Do—and Why It Matters

Computer scientists use technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s data analysis, systems automation, or user-facing applications, the goal is to build smart, efficient, and helpful solutions.

### 👥 Real Impact at Grazioso Salvare:
My dashboard allowed team members to interact with outcome data easily—no spreadsheets required. With filters, visuals, and dynamic displays, they could:
- Identify trends
- Make faster decisions
- Work more efficiently

This project wasn’t just about writing code—it was about making **their mission easier to achieve**.
